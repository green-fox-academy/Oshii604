      <div class="aboutme"> 
        <p> Working in the event-industry for more than 14 years made me realize, that the scene is quite vulnerable to financial and health crises. I was personally affected pretty hard in both of 2008 (Economic recession) and 2020 (Covid-19) "meltdowns" of the event-industry.
          <p> By becoming a junior software developer I think I'll have a safer future, and since I was always attracted to computers I feel, this career path is really suitable for me.
